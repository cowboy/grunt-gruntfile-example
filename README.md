# Grunt "init:gruntfile" example

This is example output generated by the "grunt init:gruntfile" task.

_Note: this repository was generated dynamically using grunt v0.3.8. Instead of
reporting issues here, please report any issues with this repository as
[grunt issues][issues]. Instead of watching or forking this repository,
watch [grunt][grunt] and use the grunt [init task][init]._

## Project Creation Transcript
The following is a transcript of the session in which this project and
repository were created. This is not actually a part of the [grunt][grunt]
"init:gruntfile" template, this session transcript was added afterwards. The
text after the `$` are the commands that were executed, and everything else is
program output. If you want to see the repository exactly as it was created by
grunt, view [the previous commit][prev].

Note that this entire build process is automated by a rather complex [expect
script][expect], which is used to automate grunt in order to facilitate the
creation of this and other [init task][init] example repositories.

```
$ mkdir grunt-gruntfile-example && cd grunt-gruntfile-example

$ git init
git remote add origin git@github.com:cowboy/grunt-gruntfile-example.git
Initialized empty Git repository in /private/tmp/grunt-gruntfile-example/.git/

$ git remote add origin git@github.com:cowboy/grunt-gruntfile-example.git

$ grunt init:gruntfile
Running "init:gruntfile" (init) task
This task will create one or more files in the current directory, based on the
environment and the answers to a few questions. Note that answering "?" to any
question will show question-specific help and answering "none" to most questions
will leave its value blank.

"gruntfile" template notes:
This template tries to guess file and directory paths, but you will most likely
need to edit the generated grunt.js file before running grunt. If you run grunt
after generating grunt.js, and grunt exits with errors, edit the grunt.js file!

Please answer the following:
[?] Is the DOM involved in ANY way? (Y/n) 
[?] Will files be concatenated or minified? (Y/n) 
[?] Will you have a package.json file? (Y/n) 
[?] Do you need to make any changes to the above before continuing? (y/N) 

Writing grunt.js...OK

Initialized from template "gruntfile".

Done, without errors.
